				<h2>Chess Lessons:</h2>
				<P><img src="images/chess-school1.jpg" width="214" height="129" hspace="8" align="right">For Public and Private Schools: Infinia Chess, LLC is offering an Online Chess School for students who desire to learn to play chess. 
				<p><B>Recent studies conclude that students who play chess perform better on standardized tests.</B>&nbsp; Chess teaches concentration, self-discipline and the ability to evaluate by logic rather than impulse while stimulating their minds and cultivating visualization skills. As a result, children become more proficient as independent decision makers with an ability to focus: students become better problem solvers while enjoying themselves. </p>
				<p>For all student ages, chess helps to bridge social, economic and cultural boundaries. It raises self-esteem, determination and perseverance while promotes good sportsmanship.</p>

				<p><img src="images/instructor1.jpg" width="150" height="150" hspace="8" align="left">To assure that our program will be safe for all students, each school will have their individual secure interface (a private place to play) made especially for the school - including their school logo. As we progress, our goal is to offer tournaments between our collaborating schools. </p>
